You will soon get great photos\n      with very little effort. I had previously returned a Panasonic Lumix\n      because the pictures were not of the quality I expected.\n      Spending the money on the Canon was a smart move.\n      I would recommend the Ixus to anyone without hesitation.\n      Two small issues to be pointed out: firstly, the battery\n      life is not fantastic. Also, the zoom is not very powerful.\n      If your subject is far away, you should not expect good results.\n      Review made by John Irving from Florida.",
